The Chow Shed - Information

Business Name: The Chow Shed

Hours of Operation: Monday - Friday 8am - 6pm

About Us: The corner of Bowen Street and The Terrace has long been a place devoid of civil society, humanity, and a place where you can have a decent cup of coffee in a relaxing but cheerful environment. We aim to preserve this tradition. By utilizing the known efficiencies of the Rotary Cow Shed to maximize the throughput of our chosen customer base (Treasury Officials), while minimizing both the cost and optimizing the casualty rate, we aim to combine the cold-hearted but cost-effective and economically rational approach of the Treasury with the proven practicalites of the New Zealand Dairy industry.
