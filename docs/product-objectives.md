The Chow Shed website

Introduction (or Mission Statement or something...)
 - The corner of Bowen Street and The Terrace has long been a place devoid of civil society, humanity, and a place where you can have a decent cup of coffee in a relaxing but cheerful environment. We aim to preserve this tradition. By utilizing the known efficiencies of the Rotary Cow Shed to maximize the throughput of our chosen customer base (Treasury Officials), while minimizing both the cost and optimizing the casualty rate, we aim to combine the cold-hearted but cost-effective and economically rational approach of the Treasury with the proven practicalites of the New Zealand Dairy industry. This website will clearly explain this ground-breaking radical approach to our user base. This one is bound to be a winner.


 - Objectives:
   - to optimize caffeine and calorie loading for Tresury Officials
   - to bring cold-hearted efficiency to the Treasury lunch break
   - by utilizing the known efficiencies of the Rotary Cowshed to revolutionize break time for Treasury Staff
   - to minimize...no...no...optimize customer casualty rate (a cost-benefit analysis revealed that a zero casualty rate had economic consequences - such as potential redundancy payments, retirement packages, and so on.)
