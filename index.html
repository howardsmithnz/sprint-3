        The <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> &lt;article&gt; element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be <em>independently distributable</em> or reusable (e.g., in syndication). This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, an object, or any other independent item of content.<br> Each &lt;article&gt; should be identified, typically by including a heading (&lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt; element) as a child of the &lt;article&gt; element.

        The <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> &lt;aside&gt; element represents a section of the page with content connected tangentially to the rest, which could be considered <em>separate</em> from that content. These sections are often represented as sidebars or inserts. They often contain the definitions on the sidebars, such as definitions from the glossary; there may also be other types of information, such as related advertisements; the biography of the author; <span>web applications;</span> profile information or related links on the blog. An aside could include computer code like this: <code> function foo() {
          alert("Foo!");
        }</code><br>Oh, by the way, do you know what a Grumpy Cat looks like? It looks like this:<br><img alt="That's one grumpy cat!" src="grumpy_cat.jpg"><br><br>Oh, and another thing... Julius Caesar once said <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Vini, vidi, vici.</q> (or was it Grumpy Cat?)
