In general I agreee with much of what was presented in the article. The web is obviously a highly visual medium, therefore it is to be expected that a web developer will initially focus their efforts on a site's visual component. However it should be borne in mind that a number of potential users will not be able to utilize the site based on this standard visual information alone. Web developers should therefore make some efforts to accomodate users with some perception issues. The degree to which this may be required may depend upon the type of website and the expected user base. For example, a website which specializes in offering social services to visually impaired people will need to be designes with great emphasis given to non-visual accessibilty. But even a web site which presents the work of great visual artists should carefully pay attention to the needs of users with visual problems. Of course perception issues are not limited to those with visual issues. A practical way for web developers to check that their web pages are accessible to all, is to frequently use suitable validation tools, such as: http://wave.webaim.org/.
