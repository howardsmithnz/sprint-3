Key Features and Benefits of Responsive Design

  - a single codebase supports all users
  - development is faster
  - maintenance is easier
  - relatively future-proof
  - good for content-based sites

Disadvantages of Responsive Design

 - performance may be slower
 - not so good for functionality-based sites (complex data and interactions may be hard to fit into modular pieces that can be shuffled)

 My Opinion

  - in general Responsive Design seems to offer more benefits than disadvantages for the majority of cases
  - however it may not take into account the different metaphors and interfaces that different systems use (e.g. Android and iPhones have a different number of hardware buttons)
